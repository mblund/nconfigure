This build tool could be used when you have huge number of .net csproj files and you need to find a correct build order. Removes the need of having a big sln file or to manually update the correct build order.

Compared to some other solutions, nConfigure also find build dependecies of static dll references.

Could be used together with MSBuild and will also generate a msbuild file.
